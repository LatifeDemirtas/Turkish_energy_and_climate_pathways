# Turkish Energy and Climate Pathways

## Abstract
The climate target of the Paris Agreement to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 oC in 2100 and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine forced the European Commission to revise the climate policy from low-carbon transition to phase-out of fossil fuels. The energy markets are vulnerable to the price volatility of fossil fuel resources due to the instability of the supplier countries. Therefore, the European countries with stringent climate mitigation aim for inter-regional cooperation with Mediterranean countries having renewable energy potential. The Turkish national energy plan, announced on January 2023, projects an increased supply of renewable primary energy sources from 24.6 Mtoe in 2020 to 48.7 Mtoe in 2035. But, the achievement of the net-zero emission target for 2053 is vague due to the uncertainties in hydrogen demand for exporting to Europe and blending domestic natural gas in Turkey. In the first part of this study, the authors aim to conduct a meta-analysis of 26 energy and climate modelling studies for Turkey by focusing on the synergies and trade-offs between the European and Turkish energy and climate policies. In the second part of this study, the authors aim to analyse the uncertainties using Bayesian inference by focusing on the low-carbon transition of the buildings and transport sectors.
